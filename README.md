# Trade Tracker App (in-progress)

A stock/options Trade Tracker app that utilizes Firestore for database operations and Firebase auth for the user management system.

I wanted to build a relatively simple, but useful, React app that did not utilize any class-based React components and instead uses hooks to manage state.
